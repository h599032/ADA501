### Script for downloading data by provided url
For now, it will only read a single url, which is hardcoded. Not sure of how automated we wanted it to be, so this will have to do for now.

## TODO
Read multiple urls, either manually or automatically?  
Store the login cookies in state, such that we don't have to login each time?  
Probably something else...
